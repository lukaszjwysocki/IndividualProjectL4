# Individual Project - Lukasz J. Wysocki
## 3D Web Viewer for Archaeology
This repository contains the code, log, meeting minutes and status reports for my individual dissertation project, which I am currently undertaking in my 4th year at the University of Glasgow. The project is being supervised by Dr Paul Henderson (https://www.pmh47.net/).

-----------------------------------

The final dissertation PDF will be viewable here upon completion: [Dissertation PDF].
All dissertation source materials, including the final pdf, will be found as the project is developed [Dissertation] folder.

This project's aim is to create an open-source and easy-to-use alternative to [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/) by expanding upon [3DHop](https://3dhop.net/) to make it easy to setup, and use, for those who may not have the technical knowledge required to use 3DHOP directly, but find that SketchFab lacks features required.
